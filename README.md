# Auto-HMM-LMF

Auto-HMM-LMF is a novel feature selection-based method to accurately predict cell line-drug associations.

The implemenation of Auto-HMM-LMF is presented in "LMf_main.py" file. Which returns the probalities that cell lines are to sensitive to drugs. The "functions.py" and "functions_2.py" include the code of fuctions that are used for evaluation and load data and code of logistic matrix factorization algorithm that is regularized by similarity matrices. The "Autoencoder.R" code implemented for feature selection of gene expression profile and copy number alteration data.
